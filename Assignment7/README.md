### THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT IS:
 - to learn to program using linked lists and to practice programming recursively.
 - to program partly functionally (e.g. the beginning of the list is always returned) and to stay away from instance variables and globals
 - to mimic, to a weak extent, programming in LISP which had as its data structure linked lists
