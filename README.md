## Assignments and Projects developed for Langara College's CPSC 1160 and CPSC 2150 
---------------------------------------------------------------

### CPSC 1160: Algorithms and Data Structures I
Course Description:<br/>
 - Students focus on practicing and developing programing skills. 
 - Students implement algorithms along with appropriate data structures to produce good software. 
 - Students apply recursion, abstract data types, algorithm analysis, sorting and searching algorithms, pointers, arrays, dynamic memory management, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
 - Students also learn low-level data representations and systematic software development.
 - As a tool, object-oriented programming is introduced.

---------------------------------------------------------------

### CPSC 2150: Algorithms and Data Structures II
Course Description:<br/>
 - Students build on the foundational concepts learned in CPSC 1160 and expand their skills to include non-linear data structures and hashing.
 - Topics include algorithm analysis, non-comparative sorting, algorithmic paradigms (divide and conquer, greedy, heuristic, backtracking, and dynamic programming), binary search trees, balanced trees, tree traversals, priority queues and heaps, Huffman codes, graphs, and graph algorithms.
  - Students implement solutions using an object-oriented programming language.
