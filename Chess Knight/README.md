### Description:
A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns.  
Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side. It can face any direction.  

All the possible places you can end up after one move look like this:

Build a function knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way (path with the least move) to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
You can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates.


The program asks for the dimension of two valid squares in the chess board (8x8) and then prints the total number of moves with the details
