### THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT IS
 - to implement the fast sorting algorithms **Quick Sort** and **Merge Sort**, and to verify that they really are much faster than the **Selection Sort**, which is a quadratic algorithm.
 - to determine the running time complexity of an algorithm based on empirical data.
